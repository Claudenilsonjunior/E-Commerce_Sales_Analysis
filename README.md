              <li>Other Electronics (2.66M units) and Laptops (2.35M units) dominate the market, together accounting for over 40% of the total sales volume.</li>
              <li>Phones (1.49M) and Power & Batteries (1.37M) remain key pillars of consumer demand, reflecting the renewal of mobile devices and the constant replacement of essential accessories.</li>
              <li>Products with ratings between 4.6 and 4.9 show the highest average sales volumes — ranging from approximately 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>

            <strong>Pricing and Discount Strategy</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show a high conversion potential</li>
              <li>Products with active coupons (of any type) sell significantly more on average than those without coupons (1,379 units).</li>
              <li>Electronics categories show an average price variation (elasticity) between 4.6% and 10.9%, indicating a relatively stable market with moderate promotional fluctuations.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>Storage</strong> and Gaming categories stand out with the highest review-to-sales ratios, suggesting strong consumer engagement. These segments typically attract a more technical and participative audience that reviews products in detail — a sign of active and influential communities around these categories.</li>
              <li>Products classified as Normal/Low Price have higher average ratings (4.30) than High Price ones (4.02). This suggests that consumers value cost-effectiveness more than luxury or technical sophistication, at least within the context of electronic e-commerce.</li>
              <li>From an executive standpoint, the data show that the “<strong>Best Seller</strong>” label is directly associated with a higher perception of quality — though not in isolation. It functions as part of a broader set of trust signals within the shopping environment.</li>

      <strong>Sales and Product Performance</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month) <ul>
            <br>The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.<br>
          <li> <strong>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</strong>: <br>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, together accounting for over 40% of the total sales volume.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely encompasses a wide range of fast-moving items (such as accessories, parts, or popular gadgets). This suggests a broad and fragmented mix with potential for better segmentation and focus on specific subcategories.</li>
            <li>Laptops maintain consistent demand, reinforcing the ongoing impact of remote work and mobility as key consumption drivers. </li>
          <li><strong>📈 Stable Growth Segments: <br></li></strong>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> remain pillars of consumer demand, reflecting the regular renewal of mobile devices and the constant replacement of essential accessories.
            <li>These two groups represent recurring consumption and offer opportunities for cross-sell strategies (e.g., smartphone + power bank bundles). </li>
          <li><strong>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate volumes, suggesting stable markets with potentially high margins, especially when tied to premium products.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> appear to be more <strong>B2B-oriented</strong> or <strong>corporate</strong> segments, suitable for targeted campaigns aimed at businesses and home offices.</li>
          <li><strong>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</li></strong>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together account for less than 10% of total sales. </li>
            <li>Despite their lower volume, these are high-margin, innovation-driven categories — especially wearables and smart home products, which align with global trends in connectivity and automation. <li>
            <li>It’s recommended to monitor the growth of these categories closely, as they may signal shifts in consumer behavior in the coming quarters.</li>
          </ul>
