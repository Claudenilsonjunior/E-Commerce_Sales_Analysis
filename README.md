      <h3>Sales and Product Performance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month)</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.
          </p>
          <h4>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, together accounting for over 40% of the total sales volume.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely encompasses a wide range of fast-moving items (such as accessories, parts, or popular gadgets). This suggests a broad and fragmented mix with potential for better segmentation and focus on specific subcategories.</li>
            <li>Laptops maintain consistent demand, reinforcing the ongoing impact of remote work and mobility as key consumption drivers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Stable Growth Segments</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> remain pillars of consumer demand, reflecting the regular renewal of mobile devices and the constant replacement of essential accessories.</li>
            <li>These two groups represent recurring consumption and offer opportunities for cross-sell strategies (e.g., smartphone + power bank bundles).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate volumes, suggesting stable markets with potentially high margins, especially when tied to premium products.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> appear to be more <strong>B2B-oriented</strong> or <strong>corporate</strong> segments, suitable for targeted campaigns aimed at businesses and home offices.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together account for less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite their lower volume, these are high-margin, innovation-driven categories — especially wearables and smart home products, which align with global trends in connectivity and automation.</li>
            <li>It’s recommended to monitor the growth of these categories closely, as they may signal shifts in consumer behavior in the coming quarters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The correlation between average rating (product_rating) and average monthly sales volume (purchased_last_month) shows a moderately positive pattern: higher-rated products tend to sell more, but not in a perfectly linear way. There are subtle dynamics that reveal consumer behavior and product positioning.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with ratings between 4.6 and 4.9 concentrate the highest average sales volumes — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>This suggests an optimal quality-perception zone, where the product is seen as reliable while still maintaining competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>Rating 4.8 stands out as the leader (3,375 average sales), surpassing even products rated 4.9 (2,146).</li>
            <li>Consumers may value cost-effectiveness more than perfection. Five-star products are sometimes perceived as “too good to be true” — often niche or more expensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Clear Drop Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below the 4.5–4.6 range, there is a consistent decline in average sales volume.</li>
            <li>From 912 units (rating 4.4) down to 677 (rating 4.1) and 514 (rating 4.0), there is nearly an 80% reduction in purchase engagement.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that online reputation is a critical decision factor, especially in marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products rated below 4.0 or equivalent numeric values (e.g., 30, 20, etc.) show nearly zero sales — averaging under 400 units.</li>
            <li>Items with ratings below 3.0 or missing ratings almost never generate sales.</li>
            <li>This indicates that consumers avoid products without an established reputation, even when the price is appealing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Possible Explanations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mid-range ratings (e.g., 4.7) outperform some higher ratings (49).</li>
            <li>Possible explanations include sampling effects (more products rated in this range) or pricing strategy — rating 4.7 may represent the best balance of perceived quality and cost.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) appear with NULL or residual values, suggesting no recorded sales or newly released products with no purchasing history yet.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <p>
            The comparison between products labeled as “Best Seller” and all other items (“Others”) reveals clear patterns of commercial success. Best sellers aren’t just top sellers — they are cheaper, have stronger reputations, and rely more on discounts and coupons as conversion triggers.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as the Main Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price of Best Sellers: $141.37, compared to $221.35 for others.</li>
            <li>Best sellers are, on average, 36% cheaper at baseline and even more accessible after discounts ($132.76 vs. $209.38).</li>
            <li>This shows that competitive value perception is central to sales performance — especially in a price-sensitive marketplace.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Strategic Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount applied: 9.02% for Best Sellers, compared to 5.79% for other products.</li>
            <li>Even though this difference looks small, the impact on volume is massive: Best Sellers sell 6,363 units per month, compared to 1,139 in other categories — 5.6× more.</li>
            <li>This highlights how small price reductions combined with strong credibility (high ratings) can accelerate sales.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Perceived Quality Is a Consistent Differentiator</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating of Best Sellers: 4.46, higher than the 4.22 average for other products.</li>
            <li>An increase of just 0.24 points is enough to significantly influence purchase decisions, proving that consumer trust (via ratings) is nearly as decisive as price.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Psychological Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3.9% of Best Sellers offer coupons, double the rate of other products (1.8%).</li>
            <li>Even though it’s a small fraction, coupon usage acts as a signal of opportunity — triggering the “good deal” mindset and increasing conversion, especially in mid-priced categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Characteristics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Sellers stand out by combining four key elements:</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong> — Lower base price and more accessible final price.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful discounts</strong> — Slightly more aggressive promotional policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong reputation</strong> — Above-average ratings reinforcing trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart offers</strong> — Moderate but strategic use of coupons.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3>Pricing and Discount Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Discounts on Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis shows that there is no direct linear correlation between discount percentage and increased sales. Instead, the behavior follows a non-linear and opportunistic pattern: certain discount ranges trigger performance spikes, while others have little to no influence on sales volume.
          </p>
          <h4>💡 Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show strong conversion potential:</li>
            <li>Especially 6%, which boosts average sales to 7,333 units, far higher than all other ranges.</li>
            <li>This suggests that small but noticeable discounts activate a psychological “opportunity trigger” without compromising margins.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges (10–16%) show inconsistent results:</li>
            <li>Sales vary between 300 and 3,161 units, with no clear pattern of proportional growth.</li>
            <li>This may indicate promotional saturation — larger discounts don’t necessarily enhance perceived value and may even create suspicion about product quality.</li>
            <li>Discounts above 20% tend to reduce average impact, but with specific exceptions:</li>
            <li>The spike at 24% (2,050 units) suggests particular campaigns or product categories where aggressive discounts are effective (likely seasonal, outlet, or high-inventory items).</li>
            <li>However, similar discounts (21–23%) generate very low volumes — typically 100–250 units — indicating that context matters more than the percentage itself.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Strategic Interpretation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The data reveals that the effectiveness of a discount is not about the percentage, but about how it is perceived:</li>
            <li>Small discounts (5–8%) perform best on popular, mid-priced products.</li>
            <li>High discounts (>20%) only work well when paired with strong visibility campaigns or clearance positioning.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges tend to dilute perceived value — customers feel neither urgency nor substantial benefit..</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧩 Likely Structural Cause</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The erratic pattern (peaks and dips) suggests influence from non-controlled variables, such as:</li>
            <li>Product category (e.g., premium electronics vs. inexpensive accessories).</li>
            <li>Seasonality (e.g., promotional spikes during commercial dates).</li>
            <li>Combination with other incentives (coupons, free shipping, homepage placement).</li>
            <li>This indicates that discount percentage alone is not a reliable predictor of volume — it must be analyzed alongside rating, base price, and best seller status.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Coupons and Discounts on Conversion</strong>
          <p>
            The results show that coupons have a significant influence on sales, but in a targeted and non-standardized way. The power of a coupon lies less in the discount amount and more in the perception of immediate benefit and exclusivity.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Coupons increase sales, but not all have the same effect</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with active coupons (of any type) sell far more on average compared to products without coupons (1,379 units).</li>
            <li>The most extreme case — “Save $0.33 with coupon” — reaches 20,000 average sales, with a 4.8 rating, showing that even symbolic incentives can trigger massive volumes.</li>
            <li>This illustrates the psychological effect of a “visible coupon”: customers are not motivated by the value itself, but by the feeling of “getting something extra.”</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Top-performing coupons combine discount + strong reputation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons paired with high ratings (≥4.4) — such as “Save $2.00”, “Save $4.00”, and “Save $1.50” — show average sales between 2,500 and 6,333 units, roughly 3 to 5 times higher than products without coupons.</li>
            <li>This indicates that product trust (rating) amplifies the coupon’s impact: the customer already trusts the product’s quality, and the discount removes the final barrier to purchase.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Percentage discounts do not guarantee higher conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons like “Save 25%” or “Save 20%” record much lower average sales (550–833), even though they offer larger reductions.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that percentage-based coupons are less tangible than fixed dollar amounts (“Save $X”), especially in low-ticket categories.</li>
            <li>Customers understand the real gain in dollars far better than in percentages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 High-value coupons don’t necessarily attract buyers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save $45.00” and “Save $133.00” show zero or very low sales despite the high discount value.</li>
            <li>These cases typically correspond to premium products, where customers are less price-sensitive and more driven by brand or performance.</li>
            <li>There may also be eligibility limits (exclusive or temporary coupons).</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Price Elasticity by Category</strong>
          <p>
            Product categories in electronics show average price variation (elasticity) between 4.6% and 10.9%, indicating a relatively stable market with moderate promotional movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few categories, however, stand out as more price-sensitive, reflecting strong competition and high substitution power.
          </p>
          <h4>⚡ Most Elastic Categories (highest average price variation)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Printers & Scanners (10.9%)</strong></li>
            <li>Highest elasticity among all categories.
The average price dropped from $210.90 to $195.90, suggesting price wars and rapid obsolescence.
This category is heavily affected by periodic promotions and easily replaceable entry-level models, which push prices downward.</li>
            <li><strong>Phones (9.9%)</strong></li>
            <li>A highly competitive, fast-moving segment, especially among mid-tier brands.
The average 10% discount shows strong consumer price sensitivity, reinforcing the importance of promotional campaigns to capture demand.
With over 1,300 products, even small variations strongly affect overall revenue.</li>
            <li><strong>Headphones (9.9%) and Storage (9.3%)</strong></li>
            <li>Typical low-unit-cost, high-replaceability segments, which explains the elasticity.
Brands compete more on price and convenience than on technical differentiation.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming (9.1%)</strong></li>
            <li>Indicates high responsiveness to promotions in accessories and peripherals.
Gaming audiences tend to respond well to short and aggressive discounts — a strong opportunity for seasonal campaigns such as Black Friday or game launches.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧠 Moderate Elasticity Categories (6–8%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (8.1%)</strong> and <strong>Speakers (6.8%)</strong> show stable variation, with average discounts below 10%.</li>
            <li>In these cases, price acts as a secondary trigger; brand and compatibility weigh more heavily on purchase decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>TV & Display (6.7%)</strong>, <strong>Networking (6.6%)</strong>, and <strong>Power & Batteries (6.5%)</strong> show predictable behavior:</li>
            <li>low promotional appeal but high average ticket, so small discounts still generate significant financial impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>💼 Least Elastic Categories (lowest price variation)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics (4.6%)</strong></li>
            <li>A generic category with low discount levels and a large number of items (1,954).</li>
            <li>Signals stable pricing or products with inelastic demand — consumers buy out of necessity, not price.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Home (6.0%) and Wearables (6.3%)</strong></li>
            <li>Innovation-driven and aspirational markets where price has less influence.</li>
            <li>Consumers value brand, design, and features, making discounts a secondary conversion factor.</li>

      <h3>Customer Behavior and Engagement</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
        <p>This analysis aims to understand not only sales volume but also customer engagement — measured here by the average number of reviews relative to each category’s average sales. The key indicator is the review-to-sales ratio, which shows how many reviews exist, on average, per unit sold.</p>
        <p> Storage (14) and Gaming (13) stand out with the highest ratios, suggesting strong consumer engagement. These segments usually attract a more technical and participative audience that evaluates products in detail — a sign of active and influential communities around these categories.</p>

<p>Next, Smart Home and Chargers & Cables (10) also show solid engagement levels. For smart home devices, reviews often reflect real-world usage and system integration; for cables and chargers, engagement signals sensitivity to quality and durability — topics that matter a lot to demanding buyers.</p>

<p>On the other hand, high-volume categories like Power & Batteries (2) and Other Electronics (2) show low relative engagement: they sell a lot but generate few reviews. This may indicate impulse purchases, low emotional involvement, or low-ticket products where customers don’t feel it’s worth leaving feedback.</p>
          <p>
            Products classified as Normal/Low Price show higher average ratings (4.30) than High Price products (4.02). This indicates that consumers value cost-effectiveness more than luxury or technical sophistication — at least within the context of the electronics e-commerce market.
          </p>
          <p>From an executive standpoint, this finding suggests several strategic insights:</p>
          <h4>Customer satisfaction is not linear with price.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Buyers of expensive products tend to have higher expectations — and therefore rate more critically when performance or delivery fails to justify the investment. Meanwhile, consumers of more affordable products often reward with higher ratings when they feel the product “delivered more than it cost.”</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>The mid-range price tier may represent the “sweet spot” of perceived value.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The 0.28-point difference in average rating (4.30 vs 4.02) is statistically relevant on platforms like Amazon, where even a tenth of a star can impact conversions. This suggests that the mid-range market (good performance + fair price) is the most appreciated and tends to generate stronger digital reputation.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Communication strategy for premium products.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Rather than competing solely on luxury, high-priced brands should emphasize storytelling around quality, durability, and post-sale support — attributes that justify the higher cost and reduce post-purchase dissatisfaction.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together account for less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite their lower volume, these are high-margin, innovation-driven categories — especially wearables and smart home products, which align with global trends in connectivity and automation.</li>
            <li>It’s recommended to monitor the growth of these categories closely, as they may signal shifts in consumer behavior in the coming quarters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The correlation between average rating (product_rating) and average monthly sales volume (purchased_last_month) shows a moderately positive pattern: higher-rated products tend to sell more, but not in a perfectly linear way. There are subtle dynamics that reveal consumer behavior and product positioning.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with ratings between 4.6 and 4.9 concentrate the highest average sales volumes — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>This suggests an optimal quality-perception zone, where the product is seen as reliable while still maintaining competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>Rating 4.8 stands out as the leader (3,375 average sales), surpassing even products rated 4.9 (2,146).</li>
            <li>Consumers may value cost-effectiveness more than perfection. Five-star products are sometimes perceived as “too good to be true” — often niche or more expensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Clear Drop Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below the 4.5–4.6 range, there is a consistent decline in average sales volume.</li>
            <li>From 912 units (rating 4.4) down to 677 (rating 4.1) and 514 (rating 4.0), there is nearly an 80% reduction in purchase engagement.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that online reputation is a critical decision factor, especially in marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products rated below 4.0 or equivalent numeric values (e.g., 30, 20, etc.) show nearly zero sales — averaging under 400 units.</li>
            <li>Items with ratings below 3.0 or missing ratings almost never generate sales.</li>
            <li>This indicates that consumers avoid products without an established reputation, even when the price is appealing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Possible Explanations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mid-range ratings (e.g., 4.7) outperform some higher ratings (49).</li>
            <li>Possible explanations include sampling effects (more products rated in this range) or pricing strategy — rating 4.7 may represent the best balance of perceived quality and cost.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) appear with NULL or residual values, suggesting no recorded sales or newly released products with no purchasing history yet.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <p>
            The comparison between products labeled as “Best Seller” and all other items (“Others”) reveals clear patterns of commercial success. Best sellers aren’t just top sellers — they are cheaper, have stronger reputations, and rely more on discounts and coupons as conversion triggers.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as the Main Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price of Best Sellers: $141.37, compared to $221.35 for others.</li>
            <li>Best sellers are, on average, 36% cheaper at baseline and even more accessible after discounts ($132.76 vs. $209.38).</li>
            <li>This shows that competitive value perception is central to sales performance — especially in a price-sensitive marketplace.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Strategic Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount applied: 9.02% for Best Sellers, compared to 5.79% for other products.</li>
            <li>Even though this difference looks small, the impact on volume is massive: Best Sellers sell 6,363 units per month, compared to 1,139 in other categories — 5.6× more.</li>
            <li>This highlights how small price reductions combined with strong credibility (high ratings) can accelerate sales.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Perceived Quality Is a Consistent Differentiator</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating of Best Sellers: 4.46, higher than the 4.22 average for other products.</li>
            <li>An increase of just 0.24 points is enough to significantly influence purchase decisions, proving that consumer trust (via ratings) is nearly as decisive as price.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Psychological Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3.9% of Best Sellers offer coupons, double the rate of other products (1.8%).</li>
            <li>Even though it’s a small fraction, coupon usage acts as a signal of opportunity — triggering the “good deal” mindset and increasing conversion, especially in mid-priced categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Characteristics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Sellers stand out by combining four key elements:</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong> — Lower base price and more accessible final price.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful discounts</strong> — Slightly more aggressive promotional policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong reputation</strong> — Above-average ratings reinforcing trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart offers</strong> — Moderate but strategic use of coupons.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
