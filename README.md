      <h3>Sales and Product Performance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month)</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.
          </p>
          <h4>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, accounting for over 40% of monthly sales.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely includes a wide range of fast-moving accessories and gadgets, suggesting a fragmented mix with potential for deeper segmentation.</li>
            <li>Laptops remain in high demand, supported by remote work trends and mobility needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Stable Growth Segments</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> continue to show strong, recurring consumption patterns.</li>
            <li>These categories enable cross-selling strategies, such as smartphone + power bank bundles.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate but stable demand with high-margin potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> may be more aligned with B2B or home-office use cases.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together represent less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite lower volume, these categories are driven by innovation and often deliver premium margins.</li>
            <li>Tracking their growth can reveal upcoming shifts in consumer behavior.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <p>
            Ratings show a moderately positive correlation with monthly sales. Higher-rated items sell more, though the pattern isn’t perfectly linear.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ratings between <strong>4.6 and 4.9</strong> drive the highest sales — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>Rating <strong>4.8</strong> performs best (3,375 average sales), surpassing even some 4.9-rated items.</li>
            <li>Five-star products can appear expensive or niche, reducing their mainstream appeal.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Decline Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below 4.5–4.6, average sales steadily drop.</li>
            <li>4.4-rated products sell around 912 units. 4.1-rated ones drop to 677, and 4.0-rated fall to 514.</li>
            <li>Reputation remains a core buying factor on online marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ratings below 4.0 — or numeric equivalents like 30 or 20 — show nearly zero sales.</li>
            <li>Products rated below 3.0 rarely sell; lack of trust outweighs pricing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Patterns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Some mid-range ratings (4.7) outperform higher ones due to better pricing or higher product availability.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) often come with NULL or minimal sales, possibly due to newly released or poorly reviewed items.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <p>
            Best sellers combine lower prices, strong ratings, and strategic discounting — a mix that dramatically increases their conversion rates.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as a Key Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price: <strong>$141.37</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>$221.35</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Final price after discounts: <strong>$132.76</strong> vs. <strong>$209.38</strong>.</li>
            <li>Best Sellers are about 36% cheaper at baseline, improving perceived value.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount: <strong>9.02%</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>5.79%</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Sales volume difference is dramatic: <strong>6,363</strong> units vs. <strong>1,139</strong> — 5.6× more.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Reputation Matters</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating: <strong>4.46</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>4.22</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>A small rating increase significantly affects purchasing decisions.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Conversion Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupon usage: <strong>3.9%</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>1.8%</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Coupons enhance perceived opportunity, especially for mid-priced items.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Features</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower baseline prices</strong></li>
            <li><strong>More impactful discounts</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Higher consumer trust (ratings)</strong></li>

      <h3>Pricing and Discount Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Discounts on Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis shows that there is no direct linear correlation between discount percentage and increased sales.
            Instead, behavior follows a non-linear and opportunistic pattern: some discount ranges trigger strong spikes,
            while others have little or no influence.
          </p>
          <h4>💡 Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show strong conversion potential. Especially 6%, boosting average sales to 7,333 units.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges (10–16%) show inconsistent results, suggesting promotional saturation.</li>
            <li>Discounts above 20% tend to reduce impact, with exceptions like 24% (2,050 units).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Strategic Interpretation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The effectiveness of a discount depends on perception, not percentage.</li>
            <li>Small discounts (5–8%) work best on mid-priced popular products.</li>
            <li>High discounts (&gt;20%) only work with strong visibility or clearance positioning.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧩 Likely Structural Cause</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Erratic patterns suggest influence from uncontrolled factors:</li>
            <li>Product category, seasonality, and combined incentives (coupons, free shipping, placement).</li>
            <li>Discount percentage alone is not a reliable predictor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Coupons and Discounts on Conversion</strong>
          <p>
            Coupons strongly influence sales, but not uniformly. Their power lies less in value and more
            in perceived exclusivity and immediacy.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Coupons increase sales, but not equally</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with any coupon sell far more than those without (1,379 units).</li>
            <li>Extreme case: “Save $0.33 with coupon” reaches 20,000 average sales with 4.8 rating.</li>
            <li>Psychology matters more than the monetary amount.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Best performance: coupon + strong rating</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons with ratings ≥4.4 (Save $1.50–$4.00) reach 2,500–6,333 sales.</li>
            <li>Trust amplifies the coupon’s impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Percent discounts don’t guarantee conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save 25%” and “Save 20%” show low sales (550–833).</li>
            <li>Fixed dollar amounts are easier for customers to interpret.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 High-value coupons may still underperform</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save $45.00” and “Save $133.00” show very low or zero sales.</li>
            <li>Common in premium categories, where price sensitivity is low.</li>

          <h4>⚡ Most Elastic Categories</h4>
          <ul>

            <li><strong>Phones (9.9%)</strong> — fast-moving and highly competitive.</li>
            <li><strong>Headphones (9.9%)</strong> and <strong>Storage (9.3%)</strong> — low cost, high replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming (9.1%)</strong> — responds well to aggressive seasonal discounts.</li>

  <h3>Customer Behavior and Engagement</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This analysis examines not just sales volume but also customer engagement,
        measured through the review-to-sales ratio — the average number of reviews
        per unit sold. This metric reveals how actively customers interact with
        each category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Storage (14) and Gaming (13) lead with the highest ratios, showing strong,
        technically engaged communities that review products in detail. Smart Home
        and Chargers & Cables (10) also show solid engagement: Smart Home buyers
        evaluate real-world performance and integration, while cable and charger
        reviews often reflect concerns about durability and build quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-volume categories such as Power & Batteries (2) and Other Electronics (2)
        show low engagement relative to their sales. These products sell well but
        inspire fewer reviews, often signaling impulse buying or low emotional
        involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normal/Low Price products have higher average ratings (4.30) than High Price
        products (4.02). Customers appear to reward cost-effectiveness more than
        premium positioning within electronics e-commerce.
      </p>
      <h4>Customer satisfaction is not proportional to price.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Buyers of expensive products tend to hold higher expectations and rate
          more critically when performance or delivery does not justify the investment.
          Meanwhile, affordable products often earn higher ratings when they exceed
          expectations relative to cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The mid-range price tier may represent the strongest perceived value.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 0.28-point rating difference (4.30 vs. 4.02) is meaningful on platforms
          like Amazon, where even a tenth of a star can influence conversions.
          Mid-range items — good performance at a fair price — tend to earn more
          consistent digital reputation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Communication strategy for premium products.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          High-price brands benefit from emphasizing quality, durability, and
          post-sale support — attributes that justify the investment and help reduce
          post-purchase dissatisfaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      <p>
        Executively, the data shows that the “Best Seller” badge is associated with
        a stronger perception of quality — not as a standalone signal, but as part
        of a broader trust framework within the shopping environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Products carrying the “Best Seller” badge reach an average rating of around
        4.46, higher than regular items (4.22). In e-commerce, even small rating
        increments can translate into thousands of additional conversions in
        competitive markets.
      </p>
      <h4>The badge operates as a credibility amplifier.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The title attracts more confident buyers and reduces perceived risk.
          This drives a cycle of higher sales volume and more positive reviews,
          reinforcing the rating advantage over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Other promotional badges have limited effect.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
