          <strong>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month)</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/EiyQboz" alt="Top Selling Categories">
          <p>
            The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.
          </p>
          <h4>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, accounting for over 40% of monthly sales.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely includes a wide range of fast-moving accessories and gadgets, suggesting a fragmented mix with potential for deeper segmentation.</li>
            <li>Laptops remain in high demand, supported by remote work trends and mobility needs.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Stable Growth Segments</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> continue to show strong, recurring consumption patterns.</li>
            <li>These categories enable cross-selling strategies, such as smartphone + power bank bundles.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate but stable demand with high-margin potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> may be more aligned with B2B or home-office use cases.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together represent less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite lower volume, these categories are driven by innovation and often deliver premium margins.</li>
            <li>Tracking their growth can reveal upcoming shifts in consumer behavior.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>
<section>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Refine Subcategory Insights</strong>
      <p>Deepen the analysis of “Other Electronics” to identify leading subcategories and avoid decisions based on overly broad aggregations.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Strengthen Core Category Allocation</strong>
      <p>Reinforce inventory and marketing efforts for <strong>Laptops, Phones, and Power & Batteries</strong>, as they sustain the largest and most predictable demand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Expand Accessory Cross-Selling</strong>
      <p>Explore cross-selling opportunities between accessories and core devices.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Monitor Emerging Growth Segments</strong>
      <p>Track emerging trends in Wearables and Smart Home, which show strong potential for accelerated growth.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/1Pm6qWf" alt="Relationship Between Ratings and Sales">
          <p>
            Ratings show a moderately positive correlation with monthly sales. Higher-rated items sell more, though the pattern isn’t perfectly linear.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ratings between <strong>4.6 and 4.9</strong> drive the highest sales — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>Rating <strong>4.8</strong> performs best (3,375 average sales), surpassing even some 4.9-rated items.</li>
            <li>Five-star products can appear expensive or niche, reducing their mainstream appeal.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Decline Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below 4.5–4.6, average sales steadily drop.</li>
            <li>4.4-rated products sell around 912 units. 4.1-rated ones drop to 677, and 4.0-rated fall to 514.</li>
            <li>Reputation remains a core buying factor on online marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Ratings below 4.0 — or numeric equivalents like 30 or 20 — show nearly zero sales.</li>
            <li>Products rated below 3.0 rarely sell; lack of trust outweighs pricing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Patterns</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Some mid-range ratings (4.7) outperform higher ones due to better pricing or higher product availability.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) often come with NULL or minimal sales, possibly due to newly released or poorly reviewed items.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <section>
  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Prioritize High-Rating Products (4.6–4.9)</strong>
      <p>Focus on products rated between 46 and 49, as this group delivers higher return per unit and maintains stable reputation.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Limit Investment in Low-Rating Items (<4.4) </strong>
      <p>Avoid allocating campaign budget to products rated below 44 unless they undergo quality improvements or rebranding.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Validate Price Elasticity by Rating Tier</strong>
      <p>Analyze pricing behavior across rating bands to confirm demand elasticity — products rated 47–48 may represent the sweet spot between price and perception.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Integrate Review Monitoring Into Sales Dashboards</strong>
      <p>Include continuous review monitoring in the sales dashboard, integrating satisfaction metrics (CSAT or NPS) with commercial performance.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/jijb6Yv" alt="Best Sellers vs Others">
          <p>
            Best sellers combine lower prices, strong ratings, and strategic discounting — a mix that dramatically increases their conversion rates.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as a Key Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price: <strong>$141.37</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>$221.35</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Final price after discounts: <strong>$132.76</strong> vs. <strong>$209.38</strong>.</li>
            <li>Best Sellers are about 36% cheaper at baseline, improving perceived value.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount: <strong>9.02%</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>5.79%</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Sales volume difference is dramatic: <strong>6,363</strong> units vs. <strong>1,139</strong> — 5.6× more.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Reputation Matters</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating: <strong>4.46</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>4.22</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>A small rating increase significantly affects purchasing decisions.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Conversion Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupon usage: <strong>3.9%</strong> for Best Sellers vs. <strong>1.8%</strong> for others.</li>
            <li>Coupons enhance perceived opportunity, especially for mid-priced items.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Features</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lower baseline prices</strong></li>
            <li><strong>More impactful discounts</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Higher consumer trust (ratings)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Smart coupon usage</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <section>
  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Apply Best Seller Pricing Patterns</strong>
      <p>Replicate the pricing and discount model used by Best Sellers in products rated above 4.3, testing demand sensitivity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Use Rotating Short-Term Coupons</strong>
      <p>Invest in short-duration rotating coupons to create urgency and capture incremental traffic.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Track Early-Stage Product Ratings</strong>
      <p>Monitor reviews for newly launched products — raising the average rating above 4.4 may be the inflection point needed to enter the “Best Seller” range.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Identify High-Response Discount Segments</strong>
      <p>Run cross-category analysis to determine which product types respond best to moderate discount levels (5–10%).</p>
    </li>

      <h3>Pricing and Discount Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Discounts on Sales</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/2TwIL75" alt="Impact of Discounts">
          <p>
            The analysis shows that there is no direct linear correlation between discount percentage and increased sales.
            Instead, behavior follows a non-linear and opportunistic pattern: some discount ranges trigger strong spikes,
            while others have little or no influence.
          </p>
          <h4>💡 Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show strong conversion potential. Especially 6%, boosting average sales to 7,333 units.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges (10–16%) show inconsistent results, suggesting promotional saturation.</li>
            <li>Discounts above 20% tend to reduce impact, with exceptions like 24% (2,050 units).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Strategic Interpretation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The effectiveness of a discount depends on perception, not percentage.</li>
            <li>Small discounts (5–8%) work best on mid-priced popular products.</li>
            <li>High discounts (&gt;20%) only work with strong visibility or clearance positioning.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧩 Likely Structural Cause</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Erratic patterns suggest influence from uncontrolled factors:</li>
            <li>Product category, seasonality, and combined incentives (coupons, free shipping, placement).</li>
            <li>Discount percentage alone is not a reliable predictor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <section>
  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Test Optimal Discount Range</strong>
      <p>Prioritize A/B tests within the 5–8% discount range, which showed the strongest positive elasticity in demand.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Avoid Linear Discount Assumptions</strong>
      <p>Avoid linear “the higher the discount, the higher the sales” campaigns, since the effect does not hold consistently.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Analyze Combined Conversion Drivers</strong>
      <p>Evaluate the combined impact of discount + rating + coupon + category to reveal the true conversion inflection points.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Develop a Price Elasticity Model</strong>
      <p>Plan to build a price elasticity model that links the percentage change in discount to the percentage change in volume, allowing sensitivity quantification by product type.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Coupons and Discounts on Conversion</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/QO8bvYD" alt="Impact of Coupons">
          <p>
            Coupons strongly influence sales, but not uniformly. Their power lies less in value and more
            in perceived exclusivity and immediacy.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Coupons increase sales, but not equally</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with any coupon sell far more than those without (1,379 units).</li>
            <li>Extreme case: “Save $0.33 with coupon” reaches 20,000 average sales with 4.8 rating.</li>
            <li>Psychology matters more than the monetary amount.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Best performance: coupon + strong rating</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons with ratings ≥4.4 (Save $1.50–$4.00) reach 2,500–6,333 sales.</li>
            <li>Trust amplifies the coupon’s impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Percent discounts don’t guarantee conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save 25%” and “Save 20%” show low sales (550–833).</li>
            <li>Fixed dollar amounts are easier for customers to interpret.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 High-value coupons may still underperform</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save $45.00” and “Save $133.00” show very low or zero sales.</li>
            <li>Common in premium categories, where price sensitivity is low.</li>

  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Prioritize Coupons for High-Rated Products</strong>
      <p>Prioritize coupons on products with a rating ≥ 4.4, where strong reputation amplifies the incentive’s effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Use Fixed-Value Coupons for Stronger Impact</strong>
      <p>Prefer fixed-value coupons ($X) over percentage discounts, making the benefit more tangible and persuasive.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Avoid Excessively High Coupons</strong>
      <p>Avoid very high coupon values, which can create a perception of devaluation or poor product quality.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Use Coupons as Visibility Boosters</strong>
      <p>Leverage coupons as a visibility tool, especially for new or recently launched products — the coupon badge alone increases clicks and purchase intent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>5. Experiment With Micro-Coupons</strong>
      <p>Test campaigns using micro-coupons (e.g., Save $0.50), which have shown disproportionately strong performance.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
        <li>
          <strong>Price Elasticity by Category</strong>
          <img src="https://imgur.com/NITVs7V" alt="Price Elasticity">
          <p>
            Electronics categories show elasticity between 4.6% and 10.9%, indicating general stability with moderate promotional movement.

          <h4>⚡ Most Elastic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Printers & Scanners (10.9%)</strong> — strong price wars and obsolescence.</li>
            <li><strong>Phones (9.9%)</strong> — fast-moving and highly competitive.</li>
            <li><strong>Headphones (9.9%)</strong> and <strong>Storage (9.3%)</strong> — low cost, high replacement.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming (9.1%)</strong> — responds well to aggressive seasonal discounts.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧠 Moderate Elasticity Categories (6–8%)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (8.1%)</strong> and <strong>Speakers (6.8%)</strong> — brand outweighs price.</li>
            <li><strong>TV & Display (6.7%)</strong>, <strong>Networking (6.6%)</strong>, <strong>Power & Batteries (6.5%)</strong> — low promotional appeal but high ticket.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>💼 Least Elastic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics (4.6%)</strong> — stable pricing with inelastic demand.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart Home (6.0%)</strong> and <strong>Wearables (6.3%)</strong> — innovation-driven, less price-sensitive.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Use Tactical Discounts in Elastic Categories</strong>
      <p>Apply tactical discounts in highly elastic categories (Phones, Headphones, Printers): small adjustments (<10%) can generate substantial volume returns.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Prioritize Differentiation in Inelastic Categories</strong>
      <p>Focus on differentiation and branding in inelastic categories (Smart Home, Wearables), where price is not the primary decision driver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Implement Dynamic Pricing Models</strong>
      <p>Incorporate elasticity as a predictive variable in sales forecasting models, adjusting prices based on historical sensitivity.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Optimize the Promotional Mix</strong>
      <p>Concentrate promotional efforts on categories with high elasticity and meaningful volume, reducing margin erosion in less responsive segments.</p>

  <h3>Customer Behavior and Engagement</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Reviews and Sales</strong>
      <img src="https://imgur.com/lqr0xCF" alt="Reviews per Category">
      <p>
        The review-to-sales ratio reveals how engaged customers are with each
        product category. This metric exposes something that raw sales numbers
        hide: <strong>people don’t review everything they buy</strong> — they review what
        surprises them, disappoints them, or requires technical understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Storage</strong> stands out with the highest engagement. These products
        attract buyers who deliberate more, compare specs carefully, and leave
        detailed feedback. <strong>Chargers & Cables</strong> also show high engagement 
        relative to their modest sales volume, suggesting that even small-ticket 
        accessories can shape customer trust in the electronics ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, high-volume categories like <strong>Power & Batteries</strong> and
        <strong>Other Electronics</strong> show the opposite pattern: they sell a lot but
        generate very few reviews. This indicates <strong>low emotional involvement</strong>
        and fast, low-risk purchases — great for revenue, but weak for community
        feedback loops.
      </p>
      <section>
  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Leverage Seasonal High-Impact Discounts</strong>
      <p>The company can apply more substantial discounts during strategic periods (e.g., seasonal campaigns) without harming product value perception. This approach can boost sales volume and inventory turnover, especially in categories previously identified as having strong price elasticity.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
</section>
      <strong>Rating vs Price</strong>
      <img src="https://imgur.com/9gPAOIY" alt="Rating vs Price">
      <p>
        Across the marketplace, lower and mid-priced products consistently achieve
        higher ratings (4.30) than premium items (4.02). This reinforces a key
        behavioral pattern in e-commerce: <strong>customers reward value, not price tags</strong>.
      </p>
      <h4>Price raises expectations faster than it raises satisfaction.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Premium buyers evaluate products more critically. When performance,
          durability, or delivery falls short of the price, even slightly,
          ratings drop sharply.
        </li>
        <li>
          Affordable products benefit from the opposite effect: when they deliver
          more than expected for the price, customers respond generously.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The mid-price range creates the strongest reputation.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 0.28 rating gap is small on paper but highly influential in
          marketplaces — a tenth of a star can shift thousands of conversions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mid-range products strike the balance between cost and performance,
          producing more stable and trustworthy reputations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Premium positioning requires storytelling.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          High-price categories need stronger communication: durability,
          guarantees, real-world performance, and post-sale support.
          Without these anchors, ratings tend to penalize the brand.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
<section>
  <h3>💡 Strategic Recommendations</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Prioritize High-Engagement Categories</strong>
      <p>Categories with a high review-to-sales ratio should be prioritized for organic marketing and loyalty programs, since spontaneous engagement is highly valuable for credibility and SEO.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Boost Engagement in Low-Interaction Segments</strong>
      <p>Low-engagement categories can benefit from review-incentive campaigns (e.g., discounts on future purchases, “thank-you” coupons), increasing social proof and customer confidence.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

    <li>
      <strong>Best Sellers</strong>
      <img src="https://imgur.com/20OHnli.jpg" alt="Influence of Best Sellers">
      <p>
        Products carrying the <strong>“Best Seller”</strong> badge reach an average rating of
        4.46 — noticeably higher than regular items (4.22). This shows that the
        badge doesn’t create quality out of thin air; it amplifies it. The badge
        acts as a <strong>credibility accelerator</strong>.
      </p>
      <h4>A badge that reinforces a flywheel of trust.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More visibility → more sales → more reviews → higher ratings → more visibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the flywheel starts, it becomes difficult for competing products
          to catch up without aggressive pricing or stronger reputation signals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Short-term badges don’t build long-term trust.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Promotions like “Limited Time Deal” or “Save 10%” maintain good ratings
          (≈4.3–4.5), but their effects expire with the discount.
        </li>
        <li>
          These labels drive <strong>transactions</strong>, not <strong>brand equity</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Sellers represent accumulated authority.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The badge isn't only about volume; it reflects consistency, delivery
          reliability, and positive user experience over time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brands aiming for long-term dominance should focus less on discounts
          and more on hitting the attributes that feed this credibility loop.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
