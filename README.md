      <h3>Sales and Product Performance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month)</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.
          </p>
          <h4>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, together accounting for over 40% of the total sales volume.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely encompasses a wide range of fast-moving items (such as accessories, parts, or popular gadgets). This suggests a broad and fragmented mix with potential for better segmentation and focus on specific subcategories.</li>
            <li>Laptops maintain consistent demand, reinforcing the ongoing impact of remote work and mobility as key consumption drivers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Stable Growth Segments</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> remain pillars of consumer demand, reflecting the regular renewal of mobile devices and the constant replacement of essential accessories.</li>
            <li>These two groups represent recurring consumption and offer opportunities for cross-sell strategies (e.g., smartphone + power bank bundles).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate volumes, suggesting stable markets with potentially high margins, especially when tied to premium products.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> appear to be more <strong>B2B-oriented</strong> or <strong>corporate</strong> segments, suitable for targeted campaigns aimed at businesses and home offices.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together account for less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite their lower volume, these are high-margin, innovation-driven categories — especially wearables and smart home products, which align with global trends in connectivity and automation.</li>
            <li>It’s recommended to monitor the growth of these categories closely, as they may signal shifts in consumer behavior in the coming quarters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The correlation between average rating (product_rating) and average monthly sales volume (purchased_last_month) shows a moderately positive pattern: higher-rated products tend to sell more, but not in a perfectly linear way. There are subtle dynamics that reveal consumer behavior and product positioning.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with ratings between 4.6 and 4.9 concentrate the highest average sales volumes — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>This suggests an optimal quality-perception zone, where the product is seen as reliable while still maintaining competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>Rating 4.8 stands out as the leader (3,375 average sales), surpassing even products rated 4.9 (2,146).</li>
            <li>Consumers may value cost-effectiveness more than perfection. Five-star products are sometimes perceived as “too good to be true” — often niche or more expensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Clear Drop Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below the 4.5–4.6 range, there is a consistent decline in average sales volume.</li>
            <li>From 912 units (rating 4.4) down to 677 (rating 4.1) and 514 (rating 4.0), there is nearly an 80% reduction in purchase engagement.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that online reputation is a critical decision factor, especially in marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products rated below 4.0 or equivalent numeric values (e.g., 30, 20, etc.) show nearly zero sales — averaging under 400 units.</li>
            <li>Items with ratings below 3.0 or missing ratings almost never generate sales.</li>
            <li>This indicates that consumers avoid products without an established reputation, even when the price is appealing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Possible Explanations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mid-range ratings (e.g., 4.7) outperform some higher ratings (49).</li>
            <li>Possible explanations include sampling effects (more products rated in this range) or pricing strategy — rating 4.7 may represent the best balance of perceived quality and cost.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) appear with NULL or residual values, suggesting no recorded sales or newly released products with no purchasing history yet.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <p>
            The comparison between products labeled as “Best Seller” and all other items (“Others”) reveals clear patterns of commercial success. Best sellers aren’t just top sellers — they are cheaper, have stronger reputations, and rely more on discounts and coupons as conversion triggers.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as the Main Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price of Best Sellers: $141.37, compared to $221.35 for others.</li>
            <li>Best sellers are, on average, 36% cheaper at baseline and even more accessible after discounts ($132.76 vs. $209.38).</li>
            <li>This shows that competitive value perception is central to sales performance — especially in a price-sensitive marketplace.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Strategic Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount applied: 9.02% for Best Sellers, compared to 5.79% for other products.</li>
            <li>Even though this difference looks small, the impact on volume is massive: Best Sellers sell 6,363 units per month, compared to 1,139 in other categories — 5.6× more.</li>
            <li>This highlights how small price reductions combined with strong credibility (high ratings) can accelerate sales.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Perceived Quality Is a Consistent Differentiator</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating of Best Sellers: 4.46, higher than the 4.22 average for other products.</li>
            <li>An increase of just 0.24 points is enough to significantly influence purchase decisions, proving that consumer trust (via ratings) is nearly as decisive as price.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Psychological Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3.9% of Best Sellers offer coupons, double the rate of other products (1.8%).</li>
            <li>Even though it’s a small fraction, coupon usage acts as a signal of opportunity — triggering the “good deal” mindset and increasing conversion, especially in mid-priced categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Characteristics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Sellers stand out by combining four key elements:</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong> — Lower base price and more accessible final price.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful discounts</strong> — Slightly more aggressive promotional policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong reputation</strong> — Above-average ratings reinforcing trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart offers</strong> — Moderate but strategic use of coupons.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3>Pricing and Discount Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Discounts on Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis shows that there is no direct linear correlation between discount percentage and increased sales.
            Instead, behavior follows a non-linear and opportunistic pattern: some discount ranges trigger strong spikes,
            while others have little or no influence.
          </p>
          <h4>💡 Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show strong conversion potential. Especially 6%, boosting average sales to 7,333 units.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges (10–16%) show inconsistent results, suggesting promotional saturation.</li>
            <li>Discounts above 20% tend to reduce impact, with exceptions like 24% (2,050 units).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Strategic Interpretation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The effectiveness of a discount depends on perception, not percentage.</li>
            <li>Small discounts (5–8%) work best on mid-priced popular products.</li>
            <li>High discounts (&gt;20%) only work with strong visibility or clearance positioning.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧩 Likely Structural Cause</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Erratic patterns suggest influence from uncontrolled factors:</li>
            <li>Product category, seasonality, and combined incentives (coupons, free shipping, placement).</li>
            <li>Discount percentage alone is not a reliable predictor.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Coupons and Discounts on Conversion</strong>
          <p>
            Coupons strongly influence sales, but not uniformly. Their power lies less in value and more
            in perceived exclusivity and immediacy.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Coupons increase sales, but not equally</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with any coupon sell far more than those without (1,379 units).</li>
            <li>Extreme case: “Save $0.33 with coupon” reaches 20,000 average sales with 4.8 rating.</li>
            <li>Psychology matters more than the monetary amount.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Best performance: coupon + strong rating</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons with ratings ≥4.4 (Save $1.50–$4.00) reach 2,500–6,333 sales.</li>
            <li>Trust amplifies the coupon’s impact.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Percent discounts don’t guarantee conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save 25%” and “Save 20%” show low sales (550–833).</li>
            <li>Fixed dollar amounts are easier for customers to interpret.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 High-value coupons may still underperform</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save $45.00” and “Save $133.00” show very low or zero sales.</li>
            <li>Common in premium categories, where price sensitivity is low.</li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Printers & Scanners (10.9%)</strong> — strong price wars and obsolescence.</li>
            <li><strong>Phones (9.9%)</strong> — fast-moving and highly competitive.</li>

  <h3>Customer Behavior and Engagement</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        This analysis examines not just sales volume but also customer engagement,
        measured through the review-to-sales ratio — the average number of reviews
        per unit sold. This metric reveals how actively customers interact with
        each category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Storage (14) and Gaming (13) lead with the highest ratios, showing strong,
        technically engaged communities that review products in detail. Smart Home
        and Chargers & Cables (10) also show solid engagement: Smart Home buyers
        evaluate real-world performance and integration, while cable and charger
        reviews often reflect concerns about durability and build quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        High-volume categories such as Power & Batteries (2) and Other Electronics (2)
        show low engagement relative to their sales. These products sell well but
        inspire fewer reviews, often signaling impulse buying or low emotional
        involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normal/Low Price products have higher average ratings (4.30) than High Price
        products (4.02). Customers appear to reward cost-effectiveness more than
        premium positioning within electronics e-commerce.
      </p>
      <h4>Customer satisfaction is not proportional to price.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Buyers of expensive products tend to hold higher expectations and rate
          more critically when performance or delivery does not justify the investment.
          Meanwhile, affordable products often earn higher ratings when they exceed
          expectations relative to cost.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The mid-range price tier may represent the strongest perceived value.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The 0.28-point rating difference (4.30 vs. 4.02) is meaningful on platforms
          like Amazon, where even a tenth of a star can influence conversions.
          Mid-range items — good performance at a fair price — tend to earn more
          consistent digital reputation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Communication strategy for premium products.</h4>

          High-price brands benefit from emphasizing quality, durability, and
          post-sale support — attributes that justify the investment and help reduce
          post-purchase dissatisfaction.

        Executively, the data shows that the “Best Seller” badge is associated with
        a stronger perception of quality — not as a standalone signal, but as part
        of a broader trust framework within the shopping environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Products carrying the “Best Seller” badge reach an average rating of around
        4.46, higher than regular items (4.22). In e-commerce, even small rating
        increments can translate into thousands of additional conversions in
        competitive markets.

      <h4>The badge operates as a credibility amplifier.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The title attracts more confident buyers and reduces perceived risk.
          This drives a cycle of higher sales volume and more positive reviews,
          reinforcing the rating advantage over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Other promotional badges have limited effect.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Temporary labels like “Limited Time Deal” or “Save 10%” sustain high
          ratings (≈4.3–4.5), but their impact is shorter and driven by financial
          incentives rather than long-term brand reputation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Brand authority building.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While discounts and coupons boost short-term conversion, the Best Seller
          badge reflects accumulated trust — signaling consistent performance,
          quality, and customer satisfaction over time.
