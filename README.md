      <h3>Sales and Product Performance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Electronic Product Category Performance (Last Month)</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis of electronic product sales over the last month reveals a strong concentration in a few key categories, highlighting major opportunities for investment and portfolio optimization.
          </p>
          <h4>🥇 Top-Selling Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Electronics</strong> (2.66M units) and <strong>Laptops</strong> (2.35M units) dominate the market, together accounting for over 40% of the total sales volume.</li>
            <li>“Other Electronics” likely encompasses a wide range of fast-moving items (such as accessories, parts, or popular gadgets). This suggests a broad and fragmented mix with potential for better segmentation and focus on specific subcategories.</li>
            <li>Laptops maintain consistent demand, reinforcing the ongoing impact of remote work and mobility as key consumption drivers.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Stable Growth Segments</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Phones (1.49M)</strong> and <strong>Power & Batteries (1.37M)</strong> remain pillars of consumer demand, reflecting the regular renewal of mobile devices and the constant replacement of essential accessories.</li>
            <li>These two groups represent recurring consumption and offer opportunities for cross-sell strategies (e.g., smartphone + power bank bundles).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚙️ Niche but Strategic Categories</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Chargers & Cables (576K)</strong>, <strong>Cameras (498K)</strong>, and <strong>TV & Display (492K)</strong> show moderate volumes, suggesting stable markets with potentially high margins, especially when tied to premium products.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage, Printers & Scanners, and Networking</strong> appear to be more <strong>B2B-oriented</strong> or <strong>corporate</strong> segments, suitable for targeted campaigns aimed at businesses and home offices.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎧 Low Volume, High Value Potential</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headphones, Speakers, Wearables, Gaming, and Smart Home</strong> together account for less than 10% of total sales.</li>
            <li>Despite their lower volume, these are high-margin, innovation-driven categories — especially wearables and smart home products, which align with global trends in connectivity and automation.</li>
            <li>It’s recommended to monitor the growth of these categories closely, as they may signal shifts in consumer behavior in the coming quarters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Relationship Between Product Ratings and Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The correlation between average rating (product_rating) and average monthly sales volume (purchased_last_month) shows a moderately positive pattern: higher-rated products tend to sell more, but not in a perfectly linear way. There are subtle dynamics that reveal consumer behavior and product positioning.
          </p>
          <h4>📊 Key Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with ratings between 4.6 and 4.9 concentrate the highest average sales volumes — roughly 1,600 to 3,300 units.</li>
            <li>This suggests an optimal quality-perception zone, where the product is seen as reliable while still maintaining competitive pricing.</li>
            <li>Rating 4.8 stands out as the leader (3,375 average sales), surpassing even products rated 4.9 (2,146).</li>
            <li>Consumers may value cost-effectiveness more than perfection. Five-star products are sometimes perceived as “too good to be true” — often niche or more expensive.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 Clear Drop Starting at Rating 4.5</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Below the 4.5–4.6 range, there is a consistent decline in average sales volume.</li>
            <li>From 912 units (rating 4.4) down to 677 (rating 4.1) and 514 (rating 4.0), there is nearly an 80% reduction in purchase engagement.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that online reputation is a critical decision factor, especially in marketplaces.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Low Ratings: Direct Impact on Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products rated below 4.0 or equivalent numeric values (e.g., 30, 20, etc.) show nearly zero sales — averaging under 400 units.</li>
            <li>Items with ratings below 3.0 or missing ratings almost never generate sales.</li>
            <li>This indicates that consumers avoid products without an established reputation, even when the price is appealing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Anomalies and Possible Explanations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Mid-range ratings (e.g., 4.7) outperform some higher ratings (49).</li>
            <li>Possible explanations include sampling effects (more products rated in this range) or pricing strategy — rating 4.7 may represent the best balance of perceived quality and cost.</li>
            <li>Very low ratings (1–2) appear with NULL or residual values, suggesting no recorded sales or newly released products with no purchasing history yet.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>What Sets "Best Sellers" Apart from Other Products?</strong>
          <p>
            The comparison between products labeled as “Best Seller” and all other items (“Others”) reveals clear patterns of commercial success. Best sellers aren’t just top sellers — they are cheaper, have stronger reputations, and rely more on discounts and coupons as conversion triggers.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Price as the Main Driver</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average original price of Best Sellers: $141.37, compared to $221.35 for others.</li>
            <li>Best sellers are, on average, 36% cheaper at baseline and even more accessible after discounts ($132.76 vs. $209.38).</li>
            <li>This shows that competitive value perception is central to sales performance — especially in a price-sensitive marketplace.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎯 Strategic Discounts Boost Conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average discount applied: 9.02% for Best Sellers, compared to 5.79% for other products.</li>
            <li>Even though this difference looks small, the impact on volume is massive: Best Sellers sell 6,363 units per month, compared to 1,139 in other categories — 5.6× more.</li>
            <li>This highlights how small price reductions combined with strong credibility (high ratings) can accelerate sales.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⭐ Perceived Quality Is a Consistent Differentiator</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Average rating of Best Sellers: 4.46, higher than the 4.22 average for other products.</li>
            <li>An increase of just 0.24 points is enough to significantly influence purchase decisions, proving that consumer trust (via ratings) is nearly as decisive as price.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🎟️ Coupons as Psychological Triggers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>3.9% of Best Sellers offer coupons, double the rate of other products (1.8%).</li>
            <li>Even though it’s a small fraction, coupon usage acts as a signal of opportunity — triggering the “good deal” mindset and increasing conversion, especially in mid-priced categories.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🔍 Summary of Success Characteristics</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Best Sellers stand out by combining four key elements:</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive pricing</strong> — Lower base price and more accessible final price.</li>
            <li><strong>Meaningful discounts</strong> — Slightly more aggressive promotional policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Strong reputation</strong> — Above-average ratings reinforcing trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart offers</strong> — Moderate but strategic use of coupons.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h3>Pricing and Discount Strategy</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Discounts on Sales</strong>
          <p>
            The analysis shows that there is no direct linear correlation between discount percentage and increased sales. Instead, the behavior follows a non-linear and opportunistic pattern: certain discount ranges trigger performance spikes, while others have little to no influence on sales volume.
          </p>
          <h4>💡 Key Findings</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Moderate discounts (5–8%) show strong conversion potential:</li>
            <li>Especially 6%, which boosts average sales to 7,333 units, far higher than all other ranges.</li>
            <li>This suggests that small but noticeable discounts activate a psychological “opportunity trigger” without compromising margins.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges (10–16%) show inconsistent results:</li>
            <li>Sales vary between 300 and 3,161 units, with no clear pattern of proportional growth.</li>
            <li>This may indicate promotional saturation — larger discounts don’t necessarily enhance perceived value and may even create suspicion about product quality.</li>
            <li>Discounts above 20% tend to reduce average impact, but with specific exceptions:</li>
            <li>The spike at 24% (2,050 units) suggests particular campaigns or product categories where aggressive discounts are effective (likely seasonal, outlet, or high-inventory items).</li>
            <li>However, similar discounts (21–23%) generate very low volumes — typically 100–250 units — indicating that context matters more than the percentage itself.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Strategic Interpretation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The data reveals that the effectiveness of a discount is not about the percentage, but about how it is perceived:</li>
            <li>Small discounts (5–8%) perform best on popular, mid-priced products.</li>
            <li>High discounts (>20%) only work well when paired with strong visibility campaigns or clearance positioning.</li>
            <li>Intermediate ranges tend to dilute perceived value — customers feel neither urgency nor substantial benefit..</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>🧩 Likely Structural Cause</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The erratic pattern (peaks and dips) suggests influence from non-controlled variables, such as:</li>
            <li>Product category (e.g., premium electronics vs. inexpensive accessories).</li>
            <li>Seasonality (e.g., promotional spikes during commercial dates).</li>
            <li>Combination with other incentives (coupons, free shipping, homepage placement).</li>
            <li>This indicates that discount percentage alone is not a reliable predictor of volume — it must be analyzed alongside rating, base price, and best seller status.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Impact of Coupons and Discounts on Conversion</strong>
          <p>
            The results show that coupons have a significant influence on sales, but in a targeted and non-standardized way. The power of a coupon lies less in the discount amount and more in the perception of immediate benefit and exclusivity.
          </p>
          <h4>💰 Coupons increase sales, but not all have the same effect</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Products with active coupons (of any type) sell far more on average compared to products without coupons (1,379 units).</li>
            <li>The most extreme case — “Save $0.33 with coupon” — reaches 20,000 average sales, with a 4.8 rating, showing that even symbolic incentives can trigger massive volumes.</li>
            <li>This illustrates the psychological effect of a “visible coupon”: customers are not motivated by the value itself, but by the feeling of “getting something extra.”</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📈 Top-performing coupons combine discount + strong reputation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons paired with high ratings (≥4.4) — such as “Save $2.00”, “Save $4.00”, and “Save $1.50” — show average sales between 2,500 and 6,333 units, roughly 3 to 5 times higher than products without coupons.</li>
            <li>This indicates that product trust (rating) amplifies the coupon’s impact: the customer already trusts the product’s quality, and the discount removes the final barrier to purchase.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>⚠️ Percentage discounts do not guarantee higher conversion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Coupons like “Save 25%” or “Save 20%” record much lower average sales (550–833), even though they offer larger reductions.</li>
            <li>This reinforces that percentage-based coupons are less tangible than fixed dollar amounts (“Save $X”), especially in low-ticket categories.</li>
            <li>Customers understand the real gain in dollars far better than in percentages.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>📉 High-value coupons don’t necessarily attract buyers</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>“Save $45.00” and “Save $133.00” show zero or very low sales despite the high discount value.</li>
            <li>These cases typically correspond to premium products, where customers are less price-sensitive and more driven by brand or performance.</li>
            <li>There may also be eligibility limits (exclusive or temporary coupons).</li>
          </ul>
